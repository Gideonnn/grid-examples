# CSS grid alignment

The `.item`s are now `80px` in height.

Change the `.six` element to also be a grid items. Grids can contain other grids!

## Horizontal

To horizontally align the `.item`s, we can use the `justify-items` property. put `justify-items: center;` on the `.six` class.

## Vertical

To vertically align the content, add `align-items: start;` to the `.six` class and notice nothing is happening.

If you change it to `center`, the `.six` element is now centered.
